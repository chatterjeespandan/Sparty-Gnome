# Sparty-Gnome
I worked on this project alongside Lucas Wilkerson, Alhassan Diallo, Ravi Grewal, and Hunter Samoy.

This is a 2-D scrolling game where the user is able to control a sprite(sparty gnome) and traverse various levels. The user must navigate walls, platforms,
enemy sprites to reach a door at the end of each level. Along the way a score is kept which can be influenced by items like in-game cash.

The project was developed in C++ using the wxWidgets GUI.
